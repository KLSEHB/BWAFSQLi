# BWAFSQLi
BWAFSQLi: Bypassing Web Application Firewalls with Adversarial SQL Injections.

WebSETest, which is built with HTML, PHP, and MySQL, is used for semantic equivalence verification.

SQLiCFG is a custom dataset we constructed based on a context-free grammar–driven payload generation method that incorporates a convergence factor, which randomly generates malicious and benign payloads. The dataset contains 20,000 samples (10,000 benign and 10,000 malicious) and is split in a 6:2:2 ratio: 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation.
